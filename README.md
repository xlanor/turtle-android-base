# turtle-android-base
Base Docker Image for turtle-cli.

Our ISP at work has poor routing to us-west-1, where the shell apps are hosted.
It takes me thirty minutes to rebuild my image, so I'd rather build a base and just use that image as the base.

We're using this as a turtle-cli base image for our jenkins deployment.
